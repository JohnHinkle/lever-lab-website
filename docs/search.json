    "text": "Research in the Lever Lab is driven by a common interest in in Earth’s carbon cycle. We pursue research questions of broad significance concerning the mechanistic and quantitative influence of microorganisms, humans, and abiotic factors on the short- and long-term fate of organic carbon in aquatic sediments and Earth’s crust. Currently, our research focuses on the following areas:\n\nInfluence of human societies on organic carbon sequestration in and greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic sediments.\nInteractions between paleoenvironmental, sedimentological, geochemical and microbiological processes in controlling the long-term fate of organic carbon in marine sediments.\nDeciphering anaerobic microbial food webs by linking organic carbon chemical compositions to the microorganisms and biochemical processes that transform them.\nRole of macrobiota in driving carbon and nutrient cycling in marine and freshwater sediments.\nDesigning sustainable strategies (e.g., seaweed farming) to enhance the burial of atmospheric carbon dioxide in aquatic sediments and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nImportance of tectonic processes and deep mantle-derived energy sources in sustaining subseafloor life."
